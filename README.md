# T3 Twitter Clone

## Overview

This is a simple Twitter clone built using the T3 stack. It allows users to post tweets, like tweets, and follow other users. The app is built with Next.js and TypeScript as the core technologies and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend is powered by tRPC for API communication, Prisma for database access, and NextAuth.js for authentication.

## Functionality

- User Registration: Users can log in using their Discord credentials.
- Posting Tweets: Logged-in users can post tweets by entering their message in the tweet input field and clicking the "Tweet" button.
- Liking Tweets: Users can like/unlike tweets by clicking the heart icon associated with each tweet.
- Following Users: Users can choose to follow/unfollow other users to see their tweets in their timeline.

## Advantages of using the T3 stack

1. Simplicity: The T3 stack aims for simplicity, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex configurations. The combination of Next.js and TypeScript provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications.
2. Modularity: The T3 stack is designed to be modular, enabling developers to swap components in and out as needed. This flexibility allows you to choose the best tools for your specific requirements and easily integrate them into your project.
3. Type Safety: TypeScript brings type safety to the development process, catching errors at compile-time and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. This helps improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration within a team.
4. Ecosystem and Tooling: By using Next.js and React, you gain access to a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tooling. This makes it easier to find solutions, leverage community resources, and speed up development time.
5. Full-Stack Typesafety: The T3 stack emphasizes full-stack type safety, meaning that both the frontend and backend code are written in TypeScript. This ensures consistent type checking and improves the overall stability and reliability of the application.
